#### 1. Why are you interested in programming? What have you done to expose yourself to programming so far?

I have always had an interest in programming, but I have never pursued it as a career until now. In high school, for fun, I built and maintained a personal website. I learned HTML by sifting through the source code of webpages I liked. At Seattle Central, I took an Intro to Computer Science class. I loved the challenge of creating a program to solve a problem, and at the end, seeing that I had actually built something!  I have also taken some classes on HTML and CSS at CodeSchool.com, but I haven’t found the time to dive into the material deeply. Additionally, as a math major, I have grown to love the process of problem solving and building things. Math is amazing to me because from a small number of assumptions, we can build an entire branch of mathematics.  I think programming could be a way to use my love of problem solving and building and turn it into a career.

#### 2. What are your professional goals for the next 2 years, the next 5 years?

For the next two years, my goals are to learn the skills necessary to become a web developer, and to continue to hone those at an internship or job. In five years, I hope to be continuing to grow my skills in a work environment where I am passionate what I am building. Additionally, I would eventually like to take my web development skills and use them to improve mathematics education. There are many ways I view this taking shape. I could develop and maintain a website for a volunteer tutoring service, or I could create a website to help mathematics students themselves. I feel like there are no good websites for college mathematics students to find other students in their same class, and collaborate with each other. I am also open to the idea that other inspiration will strike me as my programming skills grow! I want to use my skills at places that are trying to enact change I want to see in this world, both in my career and in my volunteer work.

#### 3. Tell us about a time you made a mistake that you learned a lot from. If you encountered the situation again, what would you do differently?

When I became a Cafe Lead at Barnes and Noble, I initially had some difficulty managing people. I made the mistake of assuming that every employee would have a good system for organizing his or her workday. In particular, I had one employee whom I will call Jane.  Although she was likable, I found that nearly every shift she didn’t get her tasks done. The way I handled this was to frequently lecture her about responsibility and initiative. I realized, though, that was unproductive. First, I was not asking Jane why she wasn’t able to get her tasks done. Secondly, I was not observing her and considering how I could create a system that would allow her to accomplish the tasks she needed to complete. I corrected this mistake by sitting down with Jane and hearing her out. We came up with a simple system that worked for her. I made a checklist that she could carry with her and mark off tasks as she completed each shift. By listening and working with Jane, together we were able to come up with a solution that worked for both of us. 


#### 4. Have you taught yourself anything before? Describe what you learned and how you approached it.

Recently, I have been teaching myself to edit videos.  I had been creating math videos for students that I tutored, but I was unhappy with their quality. My setup consisted of streaming my content through Twitch.tv, then exporting that broadcast to YouTube.  Although the videos are understandable, there was no editing and there was considerable static in the background. To improve my videos, I first consulted a friend who had done some video editing.  Through him, I discovered I should be recording my video and audio separately so I could have better control of their quality. By looking through the settings on my streaming software, I found that it also contained a function to simply record the video. To fix my audio issues, I read reviews of free audio software and found Audacity to be a good choice. I learned how to filter out background noise and amplify my own voice in Audacity by searching YouTube for tutorials about the program.  I currently use Windows Movie Maker to edit the video and audio together. I learned to use Windows Movie Maker simply by playing around with the program and seeing how different settings worked.
